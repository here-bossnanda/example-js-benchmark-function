# :rocket: example js benchmark function
A simple example compares benchmark function in javascript made by vanilla js.
I made a simple logic challenge to solve. A reverse word without affecting any special character.

> Input: 
> sekolah.mu
> | Output: 
> muhalok.es
>
> Input: 
> mdp.ac.id
> | Output: 
> dic.ap.dm
> 
> Input: 
> h!a&@.loya
> | Output: 
> a!y&@.olah

from the above problem, there 10 solutions with different logic which are in the solutions folder.
after running all benchmarks with 10000000 epoch I got a conclusion that functions the fastest to slower are:

POSITION | SOLUTION | SPEED |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | SOLUTION 6 | 1.438s |
| 2 | SOLUTION 5 | 1.977s |
| 3 | SOLUTION 4 | 2.249s |
| 4 | SOLUTION 11 | 3.542s |
| 5 | SOLUTION 1 | 5.969s |
| 6 | SOLUTION 7 | 6.173s |
| 7 | SOLUTION 8 | 6.21s |
| 8 | SOLUTION 2 | 6.753s |
| 9 | SOLUTION 10 | 12.485s |
| 10 | SOLUTION 9 | 32.434s |


SOLUTION 6 :crown:

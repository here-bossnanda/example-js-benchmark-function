# example js benchmark function
A simple example compares benchmark function in javascript made by vanilla js.
I made a simple logic challenge to solve. A reverse word without affecting any special character.

> Input: 
> sekolah.mu
> | Output: 
> muhalok.es
> 
> Input: 
> h!a&@.loya
> | Output: 
> a!y&@.olah

from the above problem, I made 6 solutions with different logic which are in the solutions folder.

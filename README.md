# example js benchmark function
A simple example compares benchmark function in javascript made by vanilla js.
I made a simple logic challenge to solve. A reverse word without affecting any special character.

> Input: 
> sekolah.mu
> | Output: 
> muhalok.es
> 
> Input: 
> h!a&@.loya
> | Output: 
> a!y&@.olah

from the above problem, I made 6 solutions with different logic which are in the solutions folder.
after running all benchmarks I got a conclusion that functions the fastest to slower are:
6.106s => SOLUTION 1
6.802s => SOLUTION 2
1.47s => SOLUTION 3
2.188s => SOLUTION 4
2.001s => SOLUTION 5
1.358s => SOLUTION 6
